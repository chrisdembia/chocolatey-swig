===============

A Chocolatey package for installing SWIG

See: [chocolatey.org/packages/swig](http://chocolatey.org/packages/swig)

**LOOKING FOR HELP MAINTAINING THIS PACKAGE** I am struggling to update 
this package with newer SWIG versions. If you'd like to help maintain this
package, let me know! Create an issue or email me.

The original maintainer was Kyle Mahan (@kylewm). Chris Dembia (@chrisdembia)
is the current maintainer.
